# This file is automatically generated and managed by the plugin.
# When you generate models for the first time, display settings from JSON files
# will be extracted and saved here. On subsequent generations, the settings
# from this file will be used instead of the JSON data.
# Make changes carefully as they will affect how models are displayed in-game.
